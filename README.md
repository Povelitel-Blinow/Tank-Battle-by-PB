# Tank battle by PB
 
This was a pet project. I was a beginner when I wrote this project. The only reason why I do not delete this repo is because I want to show off how my code style improved over time.

Do not complain when you see that **all Player Scripts are inherited from the main Player Script**. I was a noob and didn't know that composition is better than inheritance :D (I was experimenting a lot)
